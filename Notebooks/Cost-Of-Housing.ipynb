The lowest neighborhood, 3rd Ward - Duquesne, may be unanimously decided as not the best due to the other factors that come from this (cleanliness, crime, education). In my opinion, I would be happy with choosing the median neighborhood, Sewickley Heights, due to the fact that it should be a well rounded community. "
