'Final Report' notebook is what we can present to the class. No need to make slides
specifically, can just make this look nice with pictures, data sets, etc.
	- Also we are graded on our markdown that we learned so this is where we
	  can show that off

We need to pick metrics on how we want to decide what the best neighborhood is. This
could be things like crime rate, housing cost, and whatever else
	- We need to pick three and create 3 datasets for each of them to prove our point
	  kinda like what we did for the chipotle thing
	- Each do one on our own and then we can colab on the last one

Final report notebook is in repo, that we edit over time then reupload

ReadMe needs filled out but the sections that remain in it get filled as we go on

We each submit a seperate notebook to the repo. This is supposed to show work for the
metric that we seperately chose
	- Then we create a single final metric by combining our work to pick the best
	  neighborhood
